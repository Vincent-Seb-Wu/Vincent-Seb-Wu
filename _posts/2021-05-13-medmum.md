## What is Our Product?

Medmum's purpose is to make medical experiences *more efficient* both online and offline.
Our product is a online application that has three **functions:

### Appointment

## Hypothesis and Interview:

The hypothesis was that people who need to are sick or think they are sick would want to quicken their check-ups and make sure they don't waste their time thinking they had one sickness when they actually had another one.

After interviews, we got now had people reinforcing our hypothesis.

## Prototype:

Our [Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/apZj3Ndcwu5pxN56jn1CAr/MedMum?node-id=18%3A0&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1) is a app with three primary functions: **appointment**, **telemedicine**, **self diagnosis**

Consumers have the options of making an appointment at the nearest/least traffic hospital with the first function, in the telemedicine function they can talk to one of the professionals/doctors to talk about their symptoms and get a diagnosis from them, and the final function is mainly for easy access to check the range on what sicknesses the user may have as telemedicine is not 100% convenient.
