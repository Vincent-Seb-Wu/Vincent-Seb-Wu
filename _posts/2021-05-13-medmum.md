## What is Our Product?

Medmum's purpose is to make medical experiences *more efficient* both online and offline.
Our product is a online application that has three **functions:

### Appointment

### Telemedicine

### Self Diagnosis

## Hypothesis and Interview:

The hypothesis was that people who need to are sick or think they are sick would want to quicken their check-ups and make sure they don't waste their time thinking they had one sickness when they actually had another one.

After interviews, we got now had people reinforcing our hypothesis.

## Prototype:

Our [Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/apZj3Ndcwu5pxN56jn1CAr/MedMum?node-id=18%3A0&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1) is a app with three primary functions: **appointment**, **telemedicine**, **self diagnosis**

Consumers have the options of making an appointment at the nearest/least traffic hospital with the first function, in the telemedicine function they can talk to one of the professionals/doctors to talk about their symptoms and get a diagnosis from them, and the final function is mainly for easy access to check the range on what sicknesses the user may have as telemedicine is not 100% convenient.

## Smallest Possible MVP:

For this product, the smallest MVP would be having just the "appointment" function from our current product. With just that function, we can actually implement it as an API (application programming interface) for map applications like Google Maps or Apple Maps.

## Risks:

The biggest risks with this app is definitely other large company apps creating something similar for their own product. The market entry is quite low, and as we do not have as much recognition as the larger apps, we would easily be beat.

## Next Update:

In order to allow our product to survive, we should consider making our application even easier to use, and start pushing it to other application companies and cooperate with the larger corporations.
